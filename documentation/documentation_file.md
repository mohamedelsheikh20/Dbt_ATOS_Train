## Introduction

Designing a Simple Star Schema using dbt for AWS S3 Dataset on Snowflake, 
Then transform the dataset into an analytical model by defining the fact and dimension tables and perform necessary transformations in the staging models to enable analytical queries.


---
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
* the mentioned data set on your snowflake account.
* connect your dbt account to those data using connector.

### Installation
You need to set up your `yml` files depending on your snowflake dataset, but in this case the data source are the same.

### Star Schema Structure used.

![NYC Sales Star Schema System](https://github.com/mohamedelsheikh20/Dbt_ATOS_Train/assets/65075222/861ba231-e918-4a2e-9290-609272e72b6d)

As the image shows there are `Fact table` with four `Dimension tables`:
1. Req Fact Table:
   1. Contain all foreign keys `FKs` to connect all dimensions.
   2. Contain all measures to be calculated later.
   3. Contain degenerated dimensions which have no table to add in.

  
2. Tax class dimension:
   1. Every property in the city is assigned to one of four tax classes `(From 1 to 4)`, based on the use of the property.
   2. There are 2 taxes class one on sale the property and one on the present date.


3. Building class dimension:
   1. The Building Classification is used to describe a propertyâ€™s constructive use.
   2. There are 2 Building class one on sale the property and one on the present date.
   3. I added `building class category`  field include data so that users of the Rolling Sales Files can easily 
     identify similar properties by broad usage


4. Calendar date dimension:
   1. Dimension that holds sale date in date set.
   

5. Location dimension:
   1. Info about where is exactly the property using:
      1. Borough.
      2. Tax (Block and Lot).
      3. Zip code.
      4. Neighbourhood.

---
## Models
### Stage model:
(stage to clean, prepare and engineer the data).
#### path: models/staging/Schema_dbt_melsheikh/stg_dbt_melsheikh__nyc_property_sales.sql
#### Description:
* Select the main table data from `_sources.yml` in the same path.
* first of all there are some cleaned data columns: 
  * Borough_number: No nulls - only 5 distinct values.
  * Borough_name: No nulls - only 5 distinct values.
  * Sale_date: No nulls - only valid 2016 to 2018 dates.
  * Lot: No nulls - all is numeric values.
  * Block: No nulls - all is numeric values.
  * Building_class_category: No nulls - 91 distinct values.
  * Neighborhood: No nulls - 258 distinct values.
  * Tax_class_at_sale: No nulls - only numeric (1 to 4).
  * Building_class_at_sale: No nulls - data cleaned.


* second there are columns needed to be cleaned:
  (any `-` can't be cast, so it converted into null)

  * zip code, year built: Replace null values with zero.

  * Sale price:
    * Using `trim` to remove and before/after spaces.
    * Using `replace` to replace `,` and `$` with empty.
    * Using `try_cast` to cast into integer and what can't be cast make it null.

  * Square feets (Gross, Land) same operation:
    * Using `trim` to remove and before/after spaces.
    * Using `replace` to replace `,` with empty.
    * Using `try_cast` to cast into integer and what can't be cast make it null.

  * Building class at present:  If it null and building at sale contain value so duplicate the value.
    * Tax class at present: If it null and tax at sale contain value so duplicate the value. 

  * units (Residential_units, Commercial_units, Total_units): same
    operation for the 3:
    * Using `trim` to remove and before/after spaces.
    * Using `replace` to replace `,` with empty.
    * Using `try_cast` to cast into integer and what can't be cast make it null.
    * Using `case` to fill the unfilled unit (only if the other two are contain data).

  * Address: Remove the apartment number from the address (what after `,`).
    * Apartment_number: Have 3 values, main apartment value or get it from address or `UnKnown`.

    

### Dimension models:
(all dimensions take the same source from the only exist stage model)

### Tax class dimension
#### path: models/staging/Schema_dbt_melsheikh/Dimensions/Dim_Tax_class.sql
#### Description:
* Using related distinct columns:
  * tax_class_at_sale,
  * tax_class_at_present
* Add primary key generated key using the row number.



### Building class dimension
#### path: models/staging/Schema_dbt_melsheikh/Dimensions/Dim_Building_class.sql
#### Description:
* Using related distinct columns:
  * building_class_at_present.
  * building_class_at_sale.
  * Building_class_category.
* Add primary key generated key using the row number.


### Calendar date dimension
#### path: models/staging/Schema_dbt_melsheikh/Dimensions/Dim_CalendarDate.sql
#### Description:
* Using related distinct columns of dates:
* Add primary key:
  * Sale_date: same date but concatenated like `YYYYMMDD`.
* Add the date, and extract from it `day - month - year`.


### Location dimension
#### path: models/staging/Schema_dbt_melsheikh/Dimensions/Dim_Location.sql
#### Description:
* Using related distinct columns:
  * borough_name.
  * neighborhood.
  * property_zip_code.
  * tax_lot.
  * tax_block.
* Add primary key generated key using the row number.

### Fact model:
Fact table model which use the previous dimension tables to join the primary
key of them as a foreign key in fact table, also use the stage of cleaning date
which is in the source. 

### Fct Requirements fact
#### path: models/marts/Schema_dbt_melsheikh/Fct_Requerments.sql
#### Description:
1. Main fact measures columns:
   * Sale_price, Gross_square_feet_int, Land_square_feet_int, Residential_units_int, Commercial_units_int, Total_units_int, Address, apartment_number.


2. Calender foreign keys:
   1. Can be generated without the need of joining.
   2. Using the same structured used in the `Calendar Dim`.


3. Foreign keys from the dimensions:
   1. Using left join to get all the fact rows.
   2. Join is on all distinct columns considered in the mentioned dimension.

building age and sale price.

- No need to dimension because year built id are column with numeric meaning value.
- Select fact and remove `1111` values which is wrong values, but `0` is normal unknown values.
- Group by `year_built_date_id`.
- Finally, analyze the output of the price with `sum - avg - min - max`.

## Tests

There is no tests implemented yet.

## Common Issues
### Main source snowflake Table:
1. Column `Easement`: Column contain nulls only. 
   * I removed it from the stage for now.
  

2. Column `Borough_number`: Column have repeated un-used data.
each Borough have corresponding number, also this number cannot be added as foreign key 
   * I removed it from the stage for now.


3. Column `Year built`: Column have wrong row data.
   * there is in date id = `20180222` diff year in negative (mean that the house sold before it built).
